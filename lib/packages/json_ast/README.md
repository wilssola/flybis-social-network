# json_ast

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/javiercbk/json_ast.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/javiercbk/json_ast)

A forgettable port of [this javascript library](https://github.com/vtrushin/json-to-ast). It is not elegant, it doesn't bring any pride to humanity.

Builds the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of a JSON string.

## The good

* It works.
* It is battle tested.
* It could be worse (like not having anything at all).

## The bad

This library is a port from an existing javascript library. I wanted it to work but I wasn't aiming for perfection, that means:

* Types are flimsy
* Algorithms are not a jewel of modern programming.
* I ported this library to use only one feature.

## The ugly

* I would re-write the whole thing if I had any serious interest in this.
